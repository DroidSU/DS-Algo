## Greedy Algorithm
Greedy algorithm is used when we to find out the optimal solution depending on the optimal solution at that step.
Suppose we have to find the number of coins of given values would it take to get a given sum. Greedy approach can be used perfectly in that case.

## Approach
Greedy algorithm can be approached considering the following points:

    1. Declare an empty result.
    2. We make a greedy choice to select, If the choice is feasible add it to the final result.
    3. Return the result.
