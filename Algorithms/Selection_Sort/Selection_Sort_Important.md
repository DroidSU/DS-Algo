## Selection Sort
In selection sort algorithm the first element in the outer loop is selected as the smallest element and an inner loop compares the values of the index. If the value of the index in the inner loop is found to be smaller, the smallest element index is changed. In the end of the loop the value of the smallest index is swapped for the value of the outer loop index.
    - One swap for each iteration

## Time Complexity - O(n^2)
    - (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ...  =  n(n+1)/2  =  n^2
